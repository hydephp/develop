### Added

- **Added a new consolidated Asset API to better handle media files.** in [#2006](https://github.com/hydephp/develop/pull/2006)
    - Added several new fluent methods to the `MediaFile` class, like `getLink()`, `getLength()`, `getMimeType()`, etc
    - Added new `HydeFront` facade to handle CDN links and Tailwind config injection
    - Added method `Asset::exists()` to check if a media file exists
    - Added a `Hyde::assets()` method to get all media file instances in the site
- **Improved Routes facade API with more intuitive method names** in [#2179](https://github.com/hydephp/develop/pull/2179)
    - **Breaking:** Renamed `Routes::get()` to `Routes::find()` to better indicate it may return null
    - **Breaking:** Renamed `Routes::getOrFail()` to `Routes::get()` to make the exception-throwing behavior the default and match Laravel conventions
    - This change requires code updates if you were using these methods - see upgrade guide below
- **Many MediaFile related helpers have been changed or completely rewritten** to provide a simplified API for interacting with media files
    - **Note:** For most end users, the changes will have minimal direct impact, but if you have custom code that interacts with media files, you may need to update it
    - The `Asset` facade has been restructured to be more scoped and easier to use, splitting out a separate `HydeFront` facade and inlining the `AssetService` class
    - All asset retrieval methods now return a `MediaFile` instance, which can be fluently interacted with, or cast to a string to get the link (which was the previous behavior)
    - The `Hyde::asset()` method and `asset()` function now return `MediaFile` instances instead of strings, and will throw an exception if the asset does not exist
    - Renamed method `Asset::hasMediaFile` to `Asset::exists` in [#1957](https://github.com/hydephp/develop/pull/1957)
    - Renamed method `MediaFile::getContentLength` to `MediaFile::getLength` in [#1904](https://github.com/hydephp/develop/pull/1904)

    - Replaced method `Hyde::siteMediaPath` with `MediaFile::outputPath` in [#1911](https://github.com/hydephp/develop/pull/1911)

- **MediaFile performance improvements:**
    - Media assets are now cached in the HydeKernel, giving a massive performance boost and making it easier to access the instances in [#1917](https://github.com/hydephp/develop/pull/1917)
    - Media file metadata is now lazy loaded and then cached in memory, providing performance improvements for files that may not be used in a build in [#1933](https://github.com/hydephp/develop/pull/1933)
    - We now use the much faster `CRC32` hashing algorithm instead of `MD5` for cache busting keys in [#1918](https://github.com/hydephp/develop/pull/1918)
