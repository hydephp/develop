## About this repository

Contains the frontend assets for HydePHP.

### About the files

- **App.css**:
A compiled and minified file containing the TailwindCSS styles for a base Hyde installation. This file is identical to what one would get by running `npm run build` in a new HydePHP project (which incidentally is exactly how this file is generated).

## Usage

HydeFront is included with [HydePHP](https://github.com/hydephp/hyde) by default, you do not need to install it separately.
