# Changelog

Please note that this package is a companion package to `hyde/hyde` and `hyde/realtime-compiler` and is not intended to be used outside of those environments. No such support will be given, and the major version ranges used for all three must match the compatibility matrix.

## 1.0.0 (Initial Release)

- Initial release of the HydePHP Vite Plugin
- Extracted Vite server functionality from the main vite.config.js into a dedicated plugin
- Added TypeScript support
- Added configuration options for customizing input files and content refresh
- Implemented internal IPC hot file handling
