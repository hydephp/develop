# Extensions & Integrations

## HydePHP - Extensible by design

HydePHP is designed to be extensible, and comes with a number of built-in extensions and integrations,
as well as support for third-party extensions and integrations.

## First party extensions & integrations

### Realtime Compiler

The Hyde Realtime Compiler is included with Hyde installations and is what powers the `php hyde serve` command.
- Learn more about the [Realtime Compiler](realtime-compiler) in the documentation.

## Integrations with third-party tools

### Torchlight

Torchlight is an amazing API for syntax highlighting, and is supported natively by HydePHP.
- Learn more about [Torchlight](third-party-integrations#torchlight) in the documentation.
