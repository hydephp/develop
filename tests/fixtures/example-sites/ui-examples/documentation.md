# Hyde UI Kit - Documentation

The HydePHP UI Kit is a collection of minimalistic and un-opinionated TailwindCSS components for Laravel Blade,
indented to be used with HydePHP. Note that these components may require CSS classes not present in the bundled app.css
file and that you may need to recompile the CSS file using the included Tailwind and Vite configuration.

## Warning

The HydePHP UI Kit is still in development and is not yet ready for production use.
All components including their names can and probably will be changed.
